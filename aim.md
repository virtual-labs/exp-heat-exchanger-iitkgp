## Aim of experiment

This experiment enables a student to learn

- The purpose of this experiment is: To find the heat flux and heat transfer coefficients at various service and process water flow rates. 
- To determine the heat conserved, that is, the difference between the heat the hot water gives up and what the cold water receives.
